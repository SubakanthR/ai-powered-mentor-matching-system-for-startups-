# Mentor-Mentee Matching System for Startup Founders

## Overview
This project, conducted during my internship at the Centre for Entrepreneurship Development (CED) at Anna University from June 24, 2024, to July 23, 2024, aims to enhance the mentor-mentee matching process for startup founders. By leveraging advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the system improves the accuracy and relevance of mentor assignments, thereby better supporting entrepreneurs.

## Components
The project is structured into several critical components:

1. **Mentor-Mentee Matching System**
   - Define Objectives
   - Identify Key Stakeholders
   - Outline Matching Criteria
   - Design Matching Framework

2. **Domain Identification from Startup Ideas**
   - Collect Startup Ideas
   - Extract Keywords
   - Analyze Domain Relevance
   - Classify Ideas by Domain

3. **Algorithm Development and Fine-Tuning**
   - Choose Machine Learning Models
   - Develop Initial Algorithm
   - Train Algorithm on Sample Data
   - Evaluate Algorithm Performance
   - Fine-Tune Parameters

4. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Gather Data from Startups
   - Clean and Normalize Data
   - Annotate Data for Training
   - Split Data into Training and Test Sets

5. **System Evaluation and Testing**
   - Conduct Initial System Testing
   - Collect Feedback from Users
   - Identify Areas for Improvement
   - Implement Enhancements
   - Perform Final Testing and Validation
